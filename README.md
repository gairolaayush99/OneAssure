To run a Flask application that includes various dependencies like Flask, Flask-PyMongo, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS, and dotenv, you need to follow these installation steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
    - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of your project. This step is optional but highly recommended.

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv  # Create a virtual environment named 'myenv'
   source myenv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
   # or
   myenv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   - You will need to install the necessary Python packages to run your Flask application. Use `pip` to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   pip install Flask-PyMongo
   pip install Flask-JWT-Extended
   pip install Flask-CORS
   pip install python-dotenv
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. **Create a .env File**:
   - Create a `.env` file in your project directory and define the environment variables used in your code (`SECRET_KEY` and `MONGO_URI`). Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual values:

   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
   eg:
   SECRET_KEY="oneAssure"
   MONGO_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase'
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**:
   - Once you've installed the required packages and set up your `.env` file, you can run your Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Replace `your_app_name.py` with the name of the Python script where your Flask application code is located.

5. **Access Your Application**:
   - Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser or using tools like `curl` or Postman, depending on the routes you've defined in your Flask app.

Make sure your MongoDB server is running and that the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file is correctly configured to connect to your MongoDB instance.

That's it! Your Flask application should be up and running, allowing you to access the defined endpoints like `/register`, `/login`, `/addInsurance`, and `/buy-insurance`.
